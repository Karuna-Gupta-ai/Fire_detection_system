# Fire_detection_system
This project implements a real-time fire detection system using sensors and microcontroller-based technology to monitor and detect the presence of fire or smoke in an environment. The system provides alerts via SMS and the water sprinkler motor turns on if fire detected. Ideal for home automation, industrial safety, and emergency response systems.
